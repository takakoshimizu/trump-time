      <h2>Why did we make this?</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://trumpcabinettime.com/">trumpcabinettime</a> was made out of frustration and humor. Frustration that there was so much turmoil in the White House that we kept wondering how long someone would last compared to someone else in the White House. 
        This really hit home when Anthony Scaramucci was let go only 10 days after taking a position. For someone to only last ten days in a role there has to be a dysfunctional environment. 
      </p>
        So we kept asking how many mooches would it take to make a   Comey and we kept telling each other “ we should make a calculator to figure this out since there are so many units” 
        <p>
        Then we were validated when Scott Hanselman tweeted:
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;m coming up on my anniversary at Microsoft. I&#39;ve worked here for 364 Scaramuccis!</p>&mdash; Scott Hanselman (@shanselman) <a href="https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/897664205259763712">August 16, 2017</a></blockquote>

        </p>
        <p>
        We were vindicated! Other people were doing this too! That’s when we decided to actually make the calculator… We had been in meetings all day and wanted a break to do some fun stuff. So one of us handled the code while the other setup hosting and domains. By the afternoon we had the site fully running! 
        </p>
        <p>
        Since then we’ve had an outpouring of love for the site and when Steve Bannon was fired we actually had people ask us when we where going to update the site! (Which we were already working on) 
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Time to add Bannon&#39;s to the conversion</p>&mdash; Eric J Alexander (@ejaya2) <a href="https://twitter.com/ejaya2/status/898616595815084032">August 18, 2017</a></blockquote>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Might need a new unit of &quot;Bannons&quot;</p>&mdash; Brian Bimschleger (@bimschleger) <a href="https://twitter.com/bimschleger/status/898613542185717760">August 18, 2017</a></blockquote>

        <p>
        So if you need a calculator to convert smooches and bannons into spicers <a href="https://trumpcabinettime.com/">trumpcabinettime</a> is your answer! </br>
